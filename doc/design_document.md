# AI Agent Flow - Detailed Design Document

## 1. System Overview
The AI Agent Flow system is a comprehensive framework for managing AI-driven engineering tasks. It integrates multiple components including agent management, tool execution, LLM interaction, and data persistence to create a complete solution for AI-assisted software development.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Agent Management
The agent management component uses CrewAI to create, manage, and coordinate AI agents. Each agent has a specific role and set of capabilities, and can be assigned tasks to execute.

Key features:
- Agent creation with roles and backstories
- Task assignment and management
- Execution of tasks through a CrewAI-based workflow

### 2.2 MCP Tools Management
The MCP tools management component provides a framework for registering and executing various tools, with a focus on file management operations.

Key features:
- Tool registration system
- File management capabilities (list files, read files, write files)
- Standardized tool execution interface

### 2.3 LLM Interface
The LLM interface component provides a flexible way to interact with large language models through an OpenAI-compatible API.

Key features:
- Configurable base URL, model name, and API key
- Task analysis and decomposition
- Code generation capabilities
- Result validation and quality assurance

### 2.4 Data Management
The data management component uses SQLite3 to persist task results and file metadata.

Key features:
- Task history tracking with timestamps and status
- File metadata management (last modified time, size)
- Structured data storage and retrieval

### 2.5 CLI Interface
The CLI interface provides a command-line environment for user interaction.

Key features:
- Command routing for user input
- Task initiation and monitoring
- Result display and system status

## 3. System Workflow

### 3.1 Task Processing
1. User submits a task through the CLI
2. LLM analyzes the task and determines if additional information is needed
3. System gathers additional information through user interaction
4. Task is executed using either tool operations or LLM-generated content
5. Results are validated and stored in the database
6. Final output is presented to the user

### 3.2 Pre-Task Reasoning
The system implements a multi-step reasoning process before executing tasks:
- Initial task analysis by LLM
- Iterative gathering of additional information (up to 5 times)
- Decision making on whether to use tools or generate content
- Result validation and quality assessment

## 4. Error Handling and Recovery
- All components include comprehensive error handling
- Database operations use transactions for data integrity
- CLI handles keyboard interrupts gracefully
- Task results are stored with status information for audit and recovery

## 5. Extensibility
The system is designed to be extensible:
- New tools can be added to the MCP manager
- Additional agents can be defined in the agent manager
- New validation rules can be implemented in the LLM interface
- The CLI can be extended with new commands
